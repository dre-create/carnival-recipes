Jasmine's Mac-n-Cheese Pizza
--------------------------
Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

Ingredients:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups grated sharp Cheddar
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1/2 cup Parmesan
1/2 pound dried rotini pasta
Olive oil cooking spray
6 slices thick-cut good quality bacon
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
Pinch ground nutmeg
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

Servings: 8

Directions:
3. Drain and spray with olive oil cooking spray, making sure the noodles are coated well. Set aside.
4. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.
5. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings and add the butter. Add the onions, garlic and nutmeg.
6. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper and saute until the onions wilt and become translucent, about 4 minutes.
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low and sprinkle in the flour, stirring to coat the onions and garlic.
8. Continue to cook until you have a blond roux, about 5 minutes.
10. Crumble the bacon and add half to the sauce. Mix in the Cheddar and mozzarella.
11. Turn the heat to low. Add the pasta to the cheese sauce and stir to coat. Cover and keep warm.
12. In a small bowl, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, chives and olive oil.
15. Remove from the oven and set down. Spread the macaroni and cheese on the pizza, being careful to leave a 1-inch border.
